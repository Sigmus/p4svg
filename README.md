# PROCESSING-LIKE API FOR SVG

This project is a laborious, senseless, and probably meaningless, idea of ​​creating a schema, like Processing / P5.js, for building SVGs 

It is being designed so that people with some familiarity in Processing / P5.js can use what they are used to in creating SVG graphics, since the outputs of Processing.js and P5.js build graphics on canvas elements (bitmap), and not as vectors (SVG).

What is the use of this? I have no idea. But it may be useful.

Contributions in mirroring the Processing API to SVG / XML tags will be highly appreciated. They are pure manual labor.
